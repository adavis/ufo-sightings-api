![](/images/intro_image_brwngrldev_graphql.png)

This is a sample app for demonstrating creating a GraphQL API written entirely in Kotlin. It uses the following primary dependencies:
* [Ktor - Server](http://ktor.io)
* [Koin - Dependency Injection](https://github.com/Ekito/koin)
* [KGraphQL - GraphQL Server](https://github.com/pgutkowski/KGraphQL) 
* [Squash - Database Access](https://github.com/orangy/squash)


It uses UFO Sighting data freely available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings).
